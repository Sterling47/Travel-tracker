## Overview 
Travel Tracker is a webpage that connects users to the trip information with AirAkrazy. The user logins in with their traveler id and is granted access to their dashboard. The dashboard displays their past trips and has navigation to see your upcoming and pending trips. On the right side of the page the user is able to fill out the travel form and get an estimate of the trip with a 10% agents fee included. If the user is satified with the trip estimate they can submit the form to send it to the agents approval. It shows as Pending until the agent accepts the trip. There is currently no Travel agent functionality created.
